Motivation
==========

We came up with this project idea when we realized one day, that the Android app we use to track OCTranspo buses was very poorly designed. It had terribly designed, clunky UI and left us wanting for more features such as directions and stop reliability (how reliably the bus was going arrive on schedule). Worst of all, we paid money for this app, and we used it's bus-tracking functionality every day.

So we decided to do it better. 


Goals
-----

The current Android app we use can do the following:

-Track OCTranspo buses via GPS and display the next 3 trips for a stop  
-Display this result on a tiny, barely useful map  
-Search for stops via street name or stop code  
-Have favourite stops  
-Find nearby stops using the phone's GPS (Android)  
-Do all of this for a fee of $1.99  

Taking this as our motivation, we decided to everything better, with added features:

-Track OCTranspo buses via GPS and display the next 3 trips for a stop  
-Display this result on a large, clear Google Maps map complete with zoom functionality  
-Search for stops via street name or stop code in the same search box  
-Have favourite stops (need user account)  
-Find nearby stops using the phone's GPS (if accessing from mobile browser)  
-Track the popularity, and schedule reliability of each stop  
-Be available cross-platform (it's a website)  
-Do all of this for free  

We achieved most of these goals, and in the future we plan to extend this web application with those goals we didn't meet.
